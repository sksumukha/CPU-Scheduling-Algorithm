# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
The hybrid scheduling algorithm combines the Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling techniques to optimize process scheduling in operating systems. This algorithm aims to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency by considering the burst time of processes. Better Response time compared to SJF and Round Robin.
